Docker Enterprise on Digital Ocean
====

This repository serves files used along the article "Running Docker Enterprise 2.1 on DigitalOcean — Part 1" (https://link.medium.com/0XPAOy21ZR).

These are terraform scripts and ansible playbooks that provision a whole Docker Enterprise cluster using the native DigitalOcean storage and load balancers for kubernetes persistent volumes and ingress controllers.
